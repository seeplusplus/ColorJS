# Color
JavaScript RGB to Hexadecimal color converter.

# What? #
Color.JS is a small object that can be used to convert RGB color notation to Hexadecimal. 
The JS file adds many useful functions that can be used to validate/generate color formats.


+ **isRgb** and **isHex** - Validate the string used to create the instance of an object  of Color as either RGB or Hexadecimal, respectively.

+ **asRgb** - Returns the current instance's color value as an RGB value.

+ **asHex** - Returns the current instance's color value as a Hexadecimal value.

# Why? #
I created this for another project I was working on. I'm a perfectionist, however I wanted to create something that could be peer reviewed on GitHub. Input and/or constructive criticism into Color.JS in any shape or form would be greatly appreciated.
